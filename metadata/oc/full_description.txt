Megalodon is a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon">official Moshidon Android app</a> adding important features that are missing in the official app, such as the federated timeline, unlisted posting, bookmarks and an image description viewer.

<b>Key features</b>

- <b>Unlisted posting</b>: Post publicly without having your post show up in trends, hashtags or public timelines.
- <b>Federated timeline</b>: See all public posts from people on all other Fediverse neighborhoods your home instance is connected to.
- <b>Image description viewer</b>: Quickly check whether an image or video has an alt text attached to it.
- <b>Pinning posts</b>: Pin your most important posts to your profile and see what others have pinned using the “Pinned“ tab.
- <b>Bookmarks</b>: Quickly save posts and find them later in the Bookmarks list.
- <b>Follow hashtags</b>: See new posts from specific hashtags directly in your home timeline by following them.
- <b>Answering follow requests</b>: Accept or decline follow requests from your notifications or the dedicated Follow requests list.
- <b>Delete and re-draft</b>: The much-loved feature that made editing possible without an actual editing function.

<b>Unreleased official features, available in advance</b>

- Editing posts
- Integrated updater for GitHub releases
